= Gradle Build Conventions Sample

This repository contains a simple Gradle plugin project that will be used to demonstrate sharing of build conventions across multiple projects.

The plugin is implemented using Gradle's support for https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/custom_plugins.html#sec:precompiled_plugins[precompiled script plugins].

A real-world example of build conventions plugin like this is https://github.com/spring-gradle-plugins/spring-build-conventions[spring-gradle-plugins/spring-build-conventions], that's used to share common build logic between projects in Spring Security group of projects.
